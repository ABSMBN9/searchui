## Attivio Search UI Front End

The Attivio Search UI is a web application written in JavaScript and based on the React project. It runs in the userâ€™s browser. This component is in this search-ui-frontend directory and consists of application-level code for searching the Attivio index, including the definitions of the pages in the application and the logic of how they're connected.

## Developer's Guide
While developing your application, you'll want to see the effects of your changes immediately rather than relying on Maven builds producing artifacts that you can deploy. Fortunately, Node.js provides a convenient way to do this.

See the search-ui-frontend's [Developer's Guide](Developing.MD) for instructions.
